# PhpBackup4MySQL

*PhpBackup4MySQL is a very easy to use, lightweight Php class to handle MySQL
backups.
This class may be really usefull when direct exec of SQL dump is not an option
(i.e. on most shared hosting).
Despite being simple to use, this class has advanced capabilities like foreign
key constraints handling.*


PLEASE NOTE FIRST THAT THIS CLASS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT STATUS, SO YOU 
SHOULD NOT USE IT "OUT OF THE BOX" FOR PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU HAVE DONE PROPER
TESTING. THIS RESPONSIBILITY SOLELY RELIES ON YOU.
FOR THAT MATTER, IT IS REMINDED HERE THAT THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND (PLEASE REFER TO THE LICENSE FOR FULL CONDITIONS 
OF USE)

## Prerequisite 

- Php Ver 5.3
- PDO extension
- Php Curl extension for Amazon s3 upload


----
## Usage

"phpBackup4MySQL" is a php class meant to easily handle SQL backup using php.

Database connexion can be setup through the config.php file.

This class holds a few functions that can be used for that purpose but the 
basics are as simple as the example that is supplied in the "TestBackup.php"
file, that is:

1. Create an instance of PhpBackup4MySQL
2. Make a backup file with backupSQL() method
3. Save the SQL backup file with saveFile() method

Similarly, restoring a backup is as simple as the following (see example
code in "testRestore.php" file):

1. Create an instance of PhpBackup4MySQL
2. Connect to the databse with dbconnect() method
3. Restore the backup using the restoreSQL() method.

Some basic documentation can be found in the config and class comments. 


Different parameters can be accessed through the config file namely:

- Database connexion parameters.
- Directory path for the backup to be stored.
- Optional Amazon S3 credentials for upload of the backup to S3.
- "Max Query Size" to handle the limit of the SQL query that may occur when
importing back the backup, depending on the particular MySQL settings.
- "Ignore Foreign Keys" option to properly handle constraints whenever
relevant.
- "No Auto Value on Zero" option.
- Option to force table drop first before creating it (in case of database
replacement).

## Changelog

### V0.5

- Added support for Php5.4
- AWS S3 API upgrade to AWS SDK 2.7.17

name and S3 credentials in the config file, this will upload the local backup
to the declared bucket.

- Added check regarding glob() function that can have unpredicted behaviour, 
depending on host config. (kind of Php bug)

- Changed $num\_backup\_files_kept (from constant to variable and use of global)
since this was usefull for some use to have this parameter changeable.
